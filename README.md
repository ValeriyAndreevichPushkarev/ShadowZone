# Shadow Zones
Shadow Zones Computations

The main idea is to use positional encoding to preform a calculations without any active elements.

For example here is function with 2 digits:

A B   Result

01 **0**1  **0**

01 10  1

10 **0**1  **0**

10 10  1

Result = First Digit of B

Lets take another example

A B   Result

**0**1 **0**1  **0**

01 10  1

10 01  1

10 10  1


Inverted result = "Shadow" from first part of A (01) and "shadow" from first part of B (01).

Its easy to invert the results - with the help of quasi-stationary light\electromagnetic elements.

That simple tric allows to build supereffective computations based on light or electromagnetic waves (much more effective than anything).

Thats **works only with positional (one-hot) encoding** (where **you always have a zeros in a digit notation**).

And, 50 mw laser can provide enought light to compute almost anything (optics, km's of optics). 

No coherence, no headache with all other.
